            Most resturants make a burger that is over 30% fat... not here. Our
            quarter-pound patties are made from 93/7 lean ground beef and cooked
            to your liking. We pair this with crispy bacon and sharp cheddar
            cheese on a low-carb bun. Don't foget you also get our air-fried
            fries to go with your burger. On Keto, swap the bun for a lettuce
            warp and the fries for zuchinni fries.

            Did you all really think we were going to leave out pasta?! Not at
            all, we just saved it for dinner. Try our pasta (whole wheat
            available) paired with our home made alfredo sauce which is then
            tossed with freshly roasted red peppers and pan seared garlic and
            spinach. Dracula might stay away from you after all.
