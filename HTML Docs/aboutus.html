        <h3><strong>Chef Richard Klass</strong></h3>
        <p>
            When he is not enjoying a cup of tea, Chef Klass is busy making your next meal in our kitchen.  Chef Klass comes to us from Tulsa, Oklahoma.  He is a graduate of the Louisiana Culinary Institute with a specialty in Southern inspired dishes.  Chef Klass knew he wanted to be a Chef after spending time with his grandmother in the kitchen growing up.  While most boys his age were infatuated with the newest collectable cars, Chef Klass was interested in how his grandmother made her macaroni and cheese from scratch.  No box noodles on his table!
        </p> <br>
        <h3><strong>Chef Ivan Salcido</strong></h3>
        <p>
            His knife skills are some of the best in all of America!  Chef Salcido was born and raised in Orlando, Florida before joining our team.  He graduated from the Culinary Arts program at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida with a specialty in Land and Seafood.  Chef Salcido was inspired to become a Chef by watching several food networks on TV.  His approach in the kitchen is to think about the dish individually and how he can “marry” all the flavors together to give his clients the best experience possible.
        </p> <br>
        <h3><strong>Chef Angela Jimenez</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Anybody can buy bread or pasta from a bag, but Chef Jimenez knows that a truly good carbohydrate should be made from scratch.  Chef Jimenez comes to us by way of Houston, Texas.  She attended and graduated from the Culinary Institute Lenotre.  Chef Jimenez has roots in not only Hispanic Dishes, but also Italian Dishes thanks in large part to her mother, Amelia.  She is currently working on our line of “Buff Baked-Goods” which should be rolling out in the summer.
